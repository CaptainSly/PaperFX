### WIP Documentation, SUBJECT TO CHANGE


Ink Editor Version 0.0.8

A How To Guide on how to use Ink with Paper.

Ink is the Editor that allows you make content for Paper to run, ala the idiom, "You need Ink to write on Paper".


# How to create a Plugin

To create a plugin, click File -> New Plugin to create a no dependency plugin. The ability to add dependencies is on the Metadata Screen. You can also choose to use File -> Open Plugin, select your dependencies, and before you click OK, make sure the ACTIVE PLUGIN is NOT set. This will create a new one for you and you'll be able to edit the metadata. Once you click the save metadata button, it'll also save your plugin so you can open it through the dialog and set it as active when ready to work on it again.
