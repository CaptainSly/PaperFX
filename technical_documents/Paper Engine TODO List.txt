TODO List for PaperFX Version 1.0.0

PAPER
Start working on UI/Engine stuff. 

INK

Add "Test from Engine" to the Editor in Version 1.0.0
When selecting items from the lists to edit their data, prioritize pulling the data from the current plugin if it exists instead of just pulling from the database. That way we never really edit the database. 
Tighten up each tab in the editor, make any record change mark the tab as dirty. 
Give the editor fields a bit of logic so an object with conflicting and/or illegal data doesn't get sent out. 



PLUGIN STUFF
Add a flag for non-editable MAIN Plugins. I.e. Game Plugins that are published so they can't be tampered. They can still be used as dependencies, but their internally data can not be edited, only modified. (Modifying any record from another plugin saves it into the current active plugin, not the plugin the record originally came from.)




SCRIPTING STUFF

Get started on the LuaScripting Engine
